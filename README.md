Plasmonic Janus particles consist of dielectric core particles with a thin metallic cap on one side and are widely used in active matter research. 
The plasmonic cap enhances optical scattering and absorption, allowing for self-propulsion through temperature gradients as well as efficient trapping and tracking. 
The asymmetry of such a particle gives rise to **surface plasmon modes** whose excitation is sensitive to the angle at which the particle is illuminated. 
Even though the angle of illumination strongly influences the particle's scattering response, the optical properties of such metallic caps have hardly been investigated. 

We probe the light scattering of individual micrometre-sized, spherical, Au-coated Janus particles by means of **Selective Illumination Multiplexed Fourier Plane Spectroscopy**. 
This novel method allows us to explore microparticles' scattering characteristics resolved for wavelength, angle of illumination and scattering angle. 

In addition, we supplement our experimental results with **finite-element simulations** and correlate spectral markers to **orientation-dependent surface plasmon modes**. 
This additional information on the correlation of angular and spectral information could pave the way for new methods of orientation detection. They also shed new light on the interaction of such spherically capped particles with light inducing forces and torques.
